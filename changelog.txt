 - Dynamic sample rate support: audio period frames now calculated at runtime
   based on actual sample rate (32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz all supported)
 - Fixed buffer underruns with 48kHz MP3 files (e.g., outbreak.mp3)
 - Added hardware volume control via ALSA mixer (init_mixer, set_hw_volume)
 - Added `make setcap` target for setting Linux capabilities
 - Can now run as non-root user with capabilities:
   cap_sys_rawio (GPIO), cap_sys_nice (SCHED_FIFO)

12.01.2025
 - Added MP3 support via libmpg123
 - Ring buffer for MP3 streaming (~3 sec buffer at 48kHz stereo)
 - Decoder thread for MP3 runs at normal priority
 - Audio thread reads from ring buffer for MP3, direct mmap for WAV

11.24.2025
 - WAV memory allocation now dynamically done with mmap (was 480 MB RAM
   allocated, which was almost out of bounds and broke the program)
 - mlock for audio, so no demand paging (a.k.a. lazy loading), whole .wav is
   loaded into the RAM, avoiding flash page faults. Added optional
   mlockall, so all of the code and data can be loaded into the RAM.
 - Replaced fprintf() logging with syslog. Will need a proper logging thread.
